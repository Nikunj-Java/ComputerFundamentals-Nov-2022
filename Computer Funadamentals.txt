4.Touch Screen:
---------------

- Touch Screen is a computer display which is used as an input Device
- these Screen are very sensitive to pressure, user can interact with your computer by touch on som picture, Buttons etc..,
- There are Three types of Screen
	1. Resistive
	2. SurfaceWave
	3. Capcitive 

What is Resistive Touch?
	- Pressure as an input is called as resistive touch
	- it is made up of several layers of plastic and glass
	- the front layer is Scratch Resistance
	- Second layer is generally Glass
	- these both are coated with conductive material, When Someone applies Pressure to the panel, resistance is meansures between the Two Layers


What is SurfaceWave Acoustic Wave Touch Screen (SAW)?
	- it uses Utrasonic Waves to detect the touch input.
	- on tapping or touching the dislpay interface, The ultrasonic Waves in that Area are Disturbed, allowing the touch Screen's interface to detect the position of touch command
	
	BENIFITS:
	1. They are limited to using a bare finger for input
	2. They don't required a conductive object to register a touch
	3. Unlike Capacitive Touch Screen SAW touch Screen can be operated with any object that can absorb Ultrasonic Waves, Which includes Things like Heavily Gloved Hands.
	
	DISADVANTAGES:
	1. SAW  Screens are not recommended for outdoor environment
	2. as they can be affected by large amount of dirt,dust,water droplets,etc..
	3. Otherwise they  provide simple ,attractive interface for indor application
	4. Eg: Metro railway station: Automatic Ticket Machine Uses This Technology for Ticket Bookings.

What is Capacitive Touch?
	-  it uses electric properties of Human body as an input
	- When touched with finger , a small electrical charge is drawn to the point of contact.
	- it will allow the display to detect  where it has recieved as input
	- The result is a Display that can detect lighter touches and greater accuracy tha Resistive Touch.
	Eg: Mobile Touch Screen 

Which One Is Batter?

- Capacotive  technology is more rapid and it has great evolution  in recents Years
- Capacitive touch Screens are improving in Both Performance and Cost

***************************************************************************************************************
[D] PROCESSING DEVICE:
***************************************************************************************************************

1. MOTHER BOARD:
-------------------

- It is also known as MB. Main Board, Main Circuit Board.
- Bigers Board in a Computer System.
- It Allows power and also communication betwen CPU ,RAM and Other Components as Well
- Each Type of Mother Board is Designed to work with Specific types of Processors and memory, So that They don't work with  every process and type of memory 
- there are three types of sizes
	
	1. Standard ATX ( 305 x 244 mm)
		- upto 4 slots for RAM  are available , Two  or More PCI slots are Available
	2. Macro ATX (244 X 244 mm)
		- upto 2 slots for RAM are available ,it has port and slots are available
	3. Extended TX (344  x 340 mm)
		- upto 8 slots for RAM, it has more PCI slots for Fifferent Purposes.

2. PROCESSORS:
-------------------
- it is called as CPU
- logical Ciruit respond to the basic instruction which executes on your computer
- you can see CPU as IC(Integrated Circuits) chip in a Computer, Which is responsible for interpreting most of your computer commands

-Elements of CPU are
	1. ALU(ARITHMATIC AND LOGICAL UNIT):
	-----------------------------------
		- ALU is a main computer component of Central Processing Unit(CPU).
		- its main function is to perform arithmatic and logical operation
		- it is also known as Integer unit (IU) which is  IC within CPU which is the last component to perform calculation in the processor
		- it obeys Logical Gates and its values like  XOR,OR,NOT,NAND, and EX-OR operations in Logic Gates

	2. CU (CONTROL UNIT):
	-------------------------------------
		- it controles the operations of all parts of the computer but dosen't carry out any actual data processing operations
		- it is responsible for controlling data transfer
		- it manages all the units of computer
		- it communicates with input/output device for transfer of data or result from storage
		- it don't store or proccess data. 
	3. CACHE MEMORY:
	--------------------------------
		- Cache memory is high speed memory, Which is small in size but faster than main memory(RAM)
		- The CPU can access it more quickly than primary memory.
		- Cache memory can only be accessed by CPU.
		- it can be reserved part of main memory or storage device outside the CPU.
		- it holds the data of the programm which are frequently used by the CPU.
		- it make sure that the data is instantly available for CPU, whenever CPU need this data .
		- it donsn't required RAM.
		- There are Three Types of Cashe Memory:
		1. L1 : (4 parts of CPU- quad core CPU) Present Inside : 2KB to 64KB
		2. L2 : it is available outside the CPU, SIze: 256KB to 512KB
		3. L3 : not present in all processor but some High-end processor may  have this type of cache memory . This cache is used to enhance the performance ,Size: 1Mb to 8Mb
		(NOTE: larger the size of cashe memory, Slower will be the Speed)

	WORKING OF CACHE MEMORY:
	-------------------------
	- when CPU needs Data, First of all it looks insdie L1 cache. if it dosen't find  anything on L1, it find inside L2 cache.
	- if again data not found in L2 cache. it find inside L3 cache
	- if data is found in the cache memory , Then it is known as Cache Hit, or else if not found we called it as Cache Miss.

	Example:
	----------

	- when computer starts for the first time , or an aaplication  is opened  for the first time , data is not available in cache memory or in RAM.
	- in this case the CPu gets data directly from HardDrive or SSD.
	- therafter when you start your computer or open an application , CPU gets that data from  cache memory or in RAM

	4. REGISTERS:
	--------------
	- Temp . Storage
	- Registers reffered fast memory location that are present around the processor for easier access than RAM
	- it holds temporary , Constantly access data because of how fast they are
	- it increases the performance of processor

3. RAM:
-------------

- it is known as RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY
- it is a hardware in a computer device where OS , Different Applications (MS WORD,MS POWER POINR,MEDIAPLAYER,BROWSER) which use data to load application.
- RAM is a Volatile Memory.

4. ROM:
--------------

- it is known as Read only Memory
- it is memory device or storage medium which store information permanently.
- it is a type of Non-volatile memory

		WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOLATILE AND NON-VOLATILE MEMORY?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		VOLATILE MEMORY					NON-VOLATILE MEMORY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	a. data is lost when power is off		| a. data remian stored even the power is off 
	b. contents stored temporarily			| b. contents stored permanantly
	c. it is faster than non-volatile memory	| c. it is slower than Volatile Memory
	d. ex: RAM					| d. ex: ROM
	e. it can process read and write		| e. it can do Only Read
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Swith Mode Power Supply(SMPS):
----------------------------------
- it is an electronic power supply which incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power effectively.
- SMPS: transfer power from AC to DC  or DC to AC
